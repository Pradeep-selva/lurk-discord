# Lurk Discord

So, you just wanna lurk chats on discord without actually interacting, but you end up typing by mistake, people find you out and you get labelled a lurker? Well, you don't need to look any further. Just install this extension, and switch to lurk mode with a single click to remove any possibility of typing. You can always switch back to normal mode when you like!
